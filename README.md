# Attrition-prediction-using-machine-learning-in-python
Attrition prediction using machine learning in python
Project Overview:
- This project analyzes historical employee data to identify key factors influencing attrition.
- By applying various machine learning algorithms, it predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the organization.

Key Features:
-Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and correlations in the dataset.
-Feature Engineering: Selecting the most relevant attributes for better model performance.
-Model Implementation: Training and evaluating classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
-Performance Evaluation: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.
-Deployment: The trained model can be integrated into HR systems for real-time predictions.
-Technologies Used
-Programming Language: Python
-Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-Modeling Techniques: Supervised Learning, Classification Models
Impact:
-By predicting attrition, this project helps organizations take proactive measures such as improving employee engagement, adjusting policies, and reducing turnover costs.
